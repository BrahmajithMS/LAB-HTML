  <p><b>Indian farmers have said they are ending a year of mass protests a week after the government agreed to abandon controversial agricultural reforms.</b>Thousands of farmers had camped at the borders of the capital, Delhi, with dozens dying from heat, cold and Covid.They will begin returning to their homes from Saturday.The farmers were protesting against the government's introduction of three laws that loosened rules around sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - rules which have protected them from the free market for decades.Farm unions said these laws would leave farmers vulnerable to big companies and destroy their livelihoods.After months of insisting that the reforms would benefit farmers, Mr Modi announced on 19 November that his government would repeal the laws.<br>A bill to cancel the reforms was officially passed in parliament on 30 November.The move was hailed as a victory for farmers and also as a powerful example of how mass protests could still successfully challenge the government.But farmers did not leave the protest sites immediately after Mr Modi's announcement. They said they would continue to protest until the government agreed to their other demands.On Thursday, the government gave a formal letter to farm leaders, accepting many of these.<i>The movement had become one of the biggest challenges for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.</i>The farmer groups took the decision after ministers agreed to discuss their other demands, including guaranteed prices for produce and a withdrawal of criminal cases against protesting farmers.</p>

  <p>"We will hold a review meeting on 15 January. If the government doesn't fulfil its promises, we may resume the protest," farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni told local media.One of the biggest changes was that farmers were allowed to sell their produce at a market price directly to private players - agricultural businesses, supermarket chains and online grocers. Most Indian farmers currently sell the majority of their produce at government-controlled wholesale markets or mandis at assured floor prices (also known as minimum support price or MSP).The laws allowed private buyers to hoard food like rice, wheat and pulses for future sales, which only government-authorised agents could do earlier.<br>The reforms, at least on paper, gave farmers the option of selling outside of this so-called "mandi system". But the protesters said the laws would weaken the farmers and allow private players to dictate prices and control their fate. They said the MSP was keeping many farmers going and without it, many of them will struggle to survive.They said India's stringent laws around the sale of agricultural produce and high subsidies had protected farmers from market forces for decades and there was no need to change that.But the government argued that it was time to make farming profitable for even small farmers and the new laws were going to achieve that.</p>

  <p>Punjab, the SKM claims, witnessed a total of 261 farmer suicides last year.While five farmers committed suicide per week on average last year, the protest against the three laws at Delhi borders and in parts of Punjab took 16 farmers’ lives per week in the past three months (from November 26 to February 19).In January this year when the cold wave was at its peak, around 120 farmers, including 108 from Punjab alone, died during the protest. The majority of them were sitting at Delhi borders while some others died in accidents while going to or coming back from the protest sites.Forty-one farmers from Punjab died this month — till February 19. Around 10 from other states died during this period.<br>In December last year, 48 farmers from Punjab and around 10 from Haryana had died. Five from Punjab had died from November 26, the day when the farmers started their march to Delhi from Punjab, to November 30 last year.“Our farmers are living in tractor trolleys in harsh conditions. The conditions are unhygienic too because one cannot find clean toilets on the roads because of which several farmers picked illnesses and died due to several types of ailments such as cold, heart attack, brain hemorrhage, diabetes and pneumonia. Several lost their lives while travelling on the highways day and night to Singhu and Tikri borders,” said Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh, adding that several of farmers could not get timely medical aid.<br>According to the data, farmers of every age group — from 18 years to 85 years — have died.“These are pure murders as the government could have solved the problem within a week of farmers reaching Delhi borders. But the government was indifferent towards its own people,” said Jagmohan, adding that a large number of farmers suffered cardiac arrest due to extreme cold.<br>Dharminder Singh Pashour, block president of the Lehra Gaga unit of the BKU (Ugrahan), which records farmer suicides in the state, said that last year there were 12 farmer suicides in January, 20 in February, nine in March, 16 suicides in April while 15 farmers committed suicide from May 15 to June 20.<br>In five months, from June 20 to October 19, only 93 farmers committed suicide at an average of 18-19 farmer suicides every month. However, from October 20 to December 31, as many as 96 farmers committed suicide because farmers got disappointed when the Centre converted three farm ordinances into laws and even the talks with the Centre failed on October 14 last year.Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary, BKU (Ugrahan), said that the government’s cruelty has killed farmers in their 20s and 30s and “we will not let their sacrifice go waste”. “We will continue our battle till our demands are met,” he added.</p>
